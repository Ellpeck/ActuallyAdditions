# Change
- [ ] Make crystal clusters spawn in amethyst nodes in 1.18, leave unused in 1.16 (same with crystal shards)
- [ ] Possibly make the bio reactor generate more CF, but with the same mechanics
- [ ] Improve the UI of the firework box (it's missing the gradient background, and it should also have a texture)

- [ ] Add off-hand slots to energizer and enervator
- [ ] Change the recipe of casings (the lava factory ones) to give only 4, and rename them to "Lava Factory Casing"

  - [ ] Mid-tier can hold 16384 of two items
  - [ ] Highest tier can hold 32768 of four items
- [ ] Rename powered furnace to double powered furnace and add a second block which is a single powered furnace, make recipes work similarly to crusher and double crusher
- [ ] Make greenhouse glass less OP and potentially more difficult to craft
- [ ] Improve the coffee maker's ui by putting the water meter actually into the ui
- [ ] Rename phantom boosters to range boosters (since they work for other stuff too)
- [ ] Make worms use that new forge event/hook to keep the ground watered instead of trying to re-water it every few ticks
- [x] Give ender star an enchantment glint
- [ ] Make miner lens far more expensive to use, mmm power creep
