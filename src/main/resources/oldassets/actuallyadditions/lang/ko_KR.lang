booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemRelays.text.1=Before we start: The <item>Item Laser Relay<r> system is more <imp>complicated<r> than its Fluid and Energy counterpart, however, it is an <imp>extremely powerful<r> way to manage and transport your items. <n>When connecting an <item>Item Laser Relay<r> to any block that <imp>stores or handles items<r>, it will basically <imp>"know about"<r> the slots they have and what items are in them. <n>That alone isn't particularly useful, however the <item>Item Interface<r> can interact with those items. Check out <imp>its chapter<r> to find out how.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemInterfaces.name=The Item Interface
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemInterfaces.text.1=The <item>Item Interface<r> is the way to <imp>interact<r> with an <item>Item Laser Relay<r> network. On its own, such a network will just <imp>"know about"<r> all of the <imp>items and slots<r> that connected containers have. <n>The <item>Item Interface<r>, however, can be used to directly <imp>interact<r> with these items. The way the <item>Item Interface<r> works is that it basically <imp>pretends<r> to be a <imp>very large chest<r> containing <imp>every slot<r> of every container that is connected.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemInterfaces.text.2=What this means is that you can <imp>use a Hopper<r> or any other item transport mechanic on the Item Interface and it will function like a chest, being able to <imp>accept items<r> and have items <imp>pulled out of it<r>. But instead of any items being stored inside of the <item>Item Interface<r> they will go to and be pulled from <imp>the Laser Relay network<r>. <n><n>To actually <imp>connect<r> an <item>Item Interface<r> to a network, just <imp>place<r> an <item>Item Laser Relay<r> next to one.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemRelaysAdvanced.name=Advanced Item Laser Relays
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemRelaysAdvanced.text.1=Soon you will find that sometimes you will need to <imp>white- and blacklist<r> what you actaully want to go into a container. <n>The <item>Advanced Item Laser Relay<r> is able to do just that. When <imp>right-clicking<r>, you can configure a <imp>Whitelist<r> or <imp>Blacklist<r> inside of the GUI. <n>This list has two sides, however. The <imp>INBOUND<r> side basically means "things that are trying to go into the container the Relay is attached to", while <imp>OUTBOUND<r> means "things that are trying to exit the attached container".
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemRelaysAdvanced.text.2=This doesn't only work on <imp>storage containers<r> in the network, but also for <item>Item Interfaces<r>, meaning that you are able to set up a storage system and only pull out specific items in certain places.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemInterfacesHopping.name=Hopping Item Interface
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemInterfacesHopping.text.1=The <item>Hopping Item Interface<r> works the same as a normal <item>Item Interface<r>, meaning that you can <imp>connect<r> them to an <item>Item Laser Relay<r> network by placing one <imp>next to it<r>. <n>However, whereas you need to pipe items into the normal <item>Item Interface<r>, the <item>Hopping Item Interface<r> will <imp>pull and push<r> items <imp>on its own<r>. It has <imp>every functionality<r> that the <item>Hopper<r> has, but instead of storing items in an <imp>internal inventory<r>, it stores them in <imp>the network<r>.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.banners.name=Additional Banners
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.banners.text.1=For <imp>special items<r> in <imp>Actually Additions<r>, there are also special <item>Banner<r> patterns. All of these just require the <imp>item next to the banner<r> in the crafting grid with, optionally, a <imp>color<r>. You can also combine them with a <item>Shield<r> like normal. <n>The items that have a banner pattern are: <n>The <item>Actually Additions Manual<r> <n>The <item>Phantom Connector<r> <n>The <item>Leaf Blower<r> (not the advanced version) <n>The <item>Drill<r> (only the white one works due to the way banners work)

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.lushCaves.name=Lush Caves
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.lushCaves.text.1=If you have ever done any <imp>Cave exploration<r>, you will have probably noticed some <imp>caves<r> that have <imp>trees and grass<r> inside of them. <n>These can be found at any height underground all over the world, and they can be very valuable when needing wood for torches and tools at some point. Sometimes, there might also be some <imp>treasure hidden in the trees<r>! <n><n>If you didn't ever see one before, look on the <imp>next page<r> for a <imp>picture<r>!

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.waterBowl.name=Bowl of Water
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.waterBowl.text.1=The <item>Bowl of Water<r> can be obtained by <imp>right-cliking a bowl on water<r> anywhere in the world. When the <item>Bowl of Water<r> is then right-clicked onto a block, the water will be placed, much like a <item>Bucket<r>. <n><n>This can be used, for example, for early game farms. <n><n>If you don't move around <imp>carefully enough<r>, however, the water might <imp>spill out of it<r>!

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.playerInterface.name=Player Interface
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.playerInterface.text.1=The <item>Player Interface<r> works in a similar way to the <item>Phantomface<r>, except it is <imp>connected to a player<r> instead of a block, and the connection is established by <imp>placing it down<r>. <n>When <imp>inputting items<r>, they will <imp>move to the player's inventory<r>. Also, when <imp>inputting CF<r>, it will <imp>charge the items<r> in the player's inventory. <n>It has a default range of <range> blocks, however, it can be expanded by placing up to 3 <item>Phantom Boosters<r> on top of it.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.displayStand.name=Display Stand
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.displayStand.text.1=The <item>Display Stand<r> is a block that can, for one, <imp>display any item or block<r> by right-clicking with it onto the display stand. It will then be floating around on top. <n>To take it out of there again, just right-click with an empty hand. <n><n>The other feature, however, is that some items can be put onto it, <imp>having special effects<r>. This, however, will require the stand to <imp>get CF<r>. Read more on the next page.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.displayStand.text.2=The <item>Leaf Blower<r> and <item>Advanced Leaf Blower<r> can be placed onto the display stand, resulting in the grass and leaves around it to be blown away. <n><n><item>Potion Rings<r> can be placed onto the display stand. The normal version will give the specified potion effect to <imp>only one<r> living entity in a small area, while the advanced version will <imp>give a potion effect to all living entities<r> in a <imp>big area<r> while using up a significant amount of <imp>CF<r>.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemFilter.name=Item Filter
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemFilter.text.1=The <item>Item Filter<r> can be used in <item>Advanced Item Laser Relays<r>, <item>ESDs<r> and <item>Ranged Collectors<r> to <imp>enlargen the size of their whitelist<r>. This can be done by right-clicking with the filter in hand and placing items to be filtered inside of it. The filter can then be placed into any whitelist slot in the desired machine. <n>For more information on this, <imp>hover over the whitelist buttons in the GUIs of whitelistable machines<r>!
