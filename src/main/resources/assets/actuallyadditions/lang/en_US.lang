#Booklet Chapters
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.intro.name=An Introduction to ActAdd
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.intro.text.1=<i>For too long have the people of Minecraftia toiled under a relentless whip. A whip more hurtful and more injurious than that of any slave-master: inconvenience. Aye, the thousand million inconveniences that make up the grind, that force players to waste hours- nay, days!- chopping wood and farming wheat and other such mundane tasks, just to momentarily escape the remorseless tedium and experience the true joys of Minecraftia, building, caving and adventuring into the beautiful uncharted abundance
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.intro.text.2=<i>of the world. Yet no sooner has one immersed oneself in this creative enterprise than the inconveniences return, like millions of furious bees pestering, stinging, swarming all over you until the game ceases to be enjoyable, and you are driven away from it forever. To that end, a certain Ellpeck has created this Actual Addition to the world of Minecraft, that will allow the player to better engage with the core experiences of the game- building and adventuring- by automating and streamlining the monotony that
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.intro.text.3=<i>is grinding in Minecraft. Therefore, Ellpeck humbly presents to you this Actually Additions Manual, that shall teach you the ways of this modification and, ultimately, allow you to transcend inconvenience and attain enlightenment. <r><n><n>                   ~by <imp>Tulkas<r>

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.quartz.name=Black Quartz
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.quartz.text.1=<item>Black Quartz<r> is an <imp>Ore<r> that generates in the world <imp>between layer <lowest> and <highest><r>. When broken, it can be <imp>smelted in a furnace<r> or <imp>crushed in a crusher<r> to get broken down into <item>Black Quartz<r>.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.quartz.text.2=<item>Black Quartz<r> items are used in lots of <imp>Crafting Recipes<r> in <imp>Actually Additions<r>. They are very important for most of the Items and, thus, should be mined when found in the world. They can be crafted into a couple of different <imp>Decorative Blocks<r> shown on the following pages. <n>Every variant can also be crafted into <imp>Stairs, Slabs and Walls<r> using the well-known recipes. <n><n><i>Nether Quartz, but deadlier

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.lamps.name=Lamps
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.lamps.text.1=<item>Lamps<r> are a block providing lots of light, similar to the mystic Glowstone or Torches, but they can be <imp>dyed with all of the 16 different colors<r> either by <imp>crafting them<r> or by placing them on the ground and <imp>right-clicking them with a piece of dye<r>. <n>When <imp>right-clicking<r> them with an empty hand, they will <imp>turn on and off<r>.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.lamps.text.2=There is a way to toggle them with <imp>Redstone<r>, however. If you place a <item>Lamp Controller<r> facing into one and give it a <imp>redstone signal<r>, it will turn the lamp in front of it on and off. <n>The thing that makes this very expandable, though, is that it also <imp>toggles every lamp adjacent to that lamp<r> and every other lamp that gets touched. <n>That means you can have a huge field of lamps and toggle them all with <imp>just one<r> <item>Lamp Controller<r>.

Breaking them won't yield you anything, though, you just have to <imp>right-click them<r> to receive some amazing goodies.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.phantomfaces.name=Phantomfaces
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.phantomfaces.text.1=<item>Phantomfaces<r> are a simple way to <imp>connect inventories together<r>, they have a very important twist however: Instead of just connecting two inventories, a <item>Phantomface<r> <imp>simulates the inventory it is connected to<r>, meaning you can put items into and pull out of the Phantomface itself. A <item>Phantomface<r> has a <imp>default range of <range> blocks<r>, but it can be upgraded with a <item>Phantom Booster<r>. <item>Phantomfaces<r> are connected by <imp>right-clicking<r> an inventory with a <item>Phantom Connector<r> and then <imp>right-clicking<r> the <item>Phantomface.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.phantomfaces.text.2=<imp>Important Information:<r><n>It should be noted that the Phantomface is <imp>not<r> supposed to be <imp>used as a wireless transport<r> system. <n>The Phantomface should be used when, for example, wanting to input items into a machine that doesn't have enough space for the amount of cables you need around it, or when you want it to look nice in a room without needing any cables or other blocks around it. <n><n><i>It's not a short-range Tesseract.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.phantomfaces.text.4=The <item>Phantom Liquiface<r> acts exactly like the normal <item>Phantomface<r>, but it <imp>works for liquid containing blocks<r>. When given a <imp>Redstone Signal<r>, it can be set to <imp>Auto-Output<r>. Be careful with this though, as it <imp>could cause infinte loops and lag<r> under certain conditions!
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.phantomfaces.text.5=The <item>Phantom Energyface<r> acts exactly like the normal <item>Phantomface<r>, but it <imp>works for RF<r>, meaning you can connect it to things like Generators and Crushers.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.phantomBreaker.name=Phantom Breakers & Placers
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.phantomBreaker.text.1=<item>Phantom Breakers<r> and <item>Placers<r> work similarly to the normal <item>Phantomfaces<r>, except that they are used to <imp>break and place blocks from a distance<r>. Their default range is <imp><range> Blocks<r>. To connect them to blocks to break, do as described in the <imp>Phantomface Chapter<r>. When connecting them to air spaces, just place a block, store it and then break it again. <n>When right-clicking it with a <item>Redstone Torch<r> in hand, it will change between a mode where it <imp>gets deactivated by Redstone<r> and a mode where it <imp>responds to pulses<r>.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.xpSolidifier.text.1=The <item>Experience Solidifer<r> uses the player's experience and turns it into <item>Solidified Experience<r> which can later be used by <imp>right-clicking<r> (or sneak-right-clicking!) to get the experience back. <n>Additionally, you can put <item>Solidified Experience<r> into the solidifier, and, when not powered by redstone, it will <imp>pick up any XP Orbs<r> that are on the ground nearby and turn them into <item>Solidified Experience<r>, provided it has enough stored up internally. <n><item>Solidified Experience<r> is also sometimes dropped from mobs.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.greenhouseGlass.name=Greenhouse Glass
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.greenhouseGlass.text.1=<item>Greenhouse Glass<r> is a very effective way to <imp>speed up the growth of your plants<r>!

That's what <imp>RF/t<r> means. <n>To connect machines, just <imp>place them next to each other<r>. <n>Also, if you fancy that sort of thing, all machines also work with <item>Tesla<r> in the same way they do with RF.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.enderStar.name=Ender Star
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.enderStar.text.1=The <item>Ender Star<r> can be obtained by both killing a wither and going to the end to collect Dragon's Breath. The latter is obtained by using a bottle on the purple particles that the dragon spits out. <n>The <item>Ender Star<r> is used for <imp>multiple crafting recipes<r>.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.phantomRedstoneface.name=Phantom Redstoneface
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.phantomRedstoneface.text.1=<imp>If you don't know what Phantomfaces are, check the Phantomfaces Entry first.<r> <n><n>The <item>Phantom Redstoneface<r> can be used to transmit redstone signals. This one, however, <imp>works differently<r> to the other Phantomfaces as it <imp>only works in one direction<r>. What this means is that the <imp>connected block has to provide redstone power<r> for redstone next to the Redstoneface to become powered. It does <imp>not work<r> the <imp>other way<r> around.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.spawnerShard.name=Spawner Shards
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.spawnerShard.text.1=The <item>Spawner Shards<r> are a crafting ingredient found by <imp>breaking spawners<r>. Once a spawner in the world is broken, it will always drop <imp>one<r> Shard.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.spawnerChanger.name=Spawner Changer
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.spawnerChanger.text.1=The <item>Spawner Changer<r> is an item that can be used to <imp>manipulate the mobs<r> that <imp>spawners spawn<r>. <n>This can be accomplished by first of all <imp>picking up<r> the desired mob to spawn with the Changer, killing it in the process. Next, the Changer can be <imp>right-clicked on the spawner<r>, causing the spawner to be changed. <n><n>This process probably won't work with every type of mob though.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemStorage.name=Laser Relay Item Storage
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemStorage.text.1=<item>Item Laser Relays<r> work much like their <imp>energy version<r>, but instead of transferring energy, they <imp>transport items around<r>! <n><n>The basic mechanics of the <item>Item Laser Relay<r> are much the same as the <item>Energy Laser Relay<r> (read about those in the <imp>Blocks that use RF<r> section!). <n>Once connected up into a network (or <imp>system<r>), said network will <imp>know about<r> all of the inventories <imp>adjacent to<r> all of the <imp>relays<r> and will be able to interact with them.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemStorage.text.2=However, <item>Item Interfaces<r> are the way to actually communicate and <imp>interact with the entire system<r> at once, meaning you can <imp>pull items out of<r> or <imp>put into<r> an Item Interface via automation, be it Hoppers or ESDs or pipes, and they will <imp>transfer<r> the items into or out of <imp>ALL OF the inventories<r> mentioned previously. <n><n>This isn't really useful for a single inventory, but <imp>very useful<r> if you are planning to build an <imp>automated storage<r>.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemStorage.text.3=Above, you can see <imp>such a system<r>. Putting items into the left chest will cause them to be stored in the one in the middle, and the hopper on the right pulls them out of the chest in the middle. <n><n>This is <imp>more useful<r> with <imp>multiple chests<r>.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemStorage.text.4=The whole <imp>chest<r> part of this is very important, as such a setup as the one seen above <imp>will not work<r>. <n>This is because every system <imp>needs a storage space<r>, and an Item Interface does not count as that.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemStorage.text.5=But how to make a system that transports items <imp>from A to B<r>? <n>Well, just place the relay <imp>directly onto a chest<r> or hopper and the items will just go there. <n>As you can see, the <imp>amount<r> of <item>Item Interfaces<r> in one system <imp>doesn't matter<r>.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemStorage.text.6=Here, you can see the use of an <item>Advanced Item Laser Relay<r>. They can have a <imp>whitelist/blacklist configuration<r> for both connections going into them (inbound, the left side in this case) and out of them (outbound, the right side in this case).
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemStorage.text.7=You can also attach these advanced relays to <item>Item Interfaces<r>, which will mean that they will only <imp>have access<r> to certain items from the system. Here, outbound means out of the system, and inbound means into the system.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemStorage.text.8=What you can do is <imp>take this to the next level<r> and build a fully-fledged <imp>storage system<r> with multiple chests. Pulling out of or inputting into an <item>Item Interface<r> here will pull out of <imp>the entire system<r>.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemStorage.text.9=Addendum: <n><item>Advanced Item Laser Relays<r> will always <imp>take priority<r>, meaning inventories connected to them will be input into and pulled out of first. This can be useful if you want to make a <imp>storage system<r> with a <imp>last resort<r>-type chest. <n><n>Also, this system isn't only limited to chests, and there can be <imp>way more<r> than just <imp>two<r> <item>Item Interfaces<r>! <n><n><i>Gigantic storage system ahoy!

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.banners.name=Additional Banners
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.banners.text.1=For <imp>special items<r> in <imp>Actually Additions<r>, there is also special <item>Banner<r> patterns. All of these just require the <imp>item next to the banner<r> in the crafting grid with, optionally, a <imp>color<r>. You can also combine them with a <item>Shield<r> like normal. <n>The items that have a banner pattern are: <n>The <item>Actually Additions Manual<r> <n>The <item>Phantom Connector<r> <n>The <item>Leaf Blower<r> (not the advanced version) <n>The <item>Drill<r> (only the white one works due to the way banners work)

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.lushCaves.name=Lush Caves
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.lushCaves.text.1=If you have ever done any <imp>Cave exploration<r>, you will have probably noticed some <imp>caves<r> that have <imp>trees and grass<r> inside of them. <n>These can be found at any height underground all over the world, and they can be very valuable when needing wood for torches and tools at some point. <n><n>If you didn't ever see one before, look on the <imp>next page<r> for a <imp>picture<r>!

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.waterBowl.name=Bowl of Water
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.waterBowl.text.1=The <item>Bowl of Water<r> can be obtained by <imp>right-cliking a bowl on water<r> anywhere in the world. When the <item>Bowl of Water<r> is then right-clicked onto a block, the water will be placed, much like a <item>Bucket<r>. <n><n>This can be used, for example, for early game farms.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.playerInterface.name=Player Interface
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.playerInterface.text.1=The <item>Player Interface<r> works in a similar way to the <item>Phantomface<r>, except it is <imp>connected to a player<r> instead of a block, and the connection is established by <imp>placing it down<r>. <n>When <imp>inputting items<r>, they will <imp>move to the player's inventory<r>. Also, when <imp>inputting RF<r>, it will <imp>charge the items<r> in the player's inventory. <n>It has a default range of <range> blocks, however, it can be expanded by placing up to 3 <item>Phantom Boosters<r> on top of it.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.displayStand.name=Display Stand
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.displayStand.text.1=The <item>Display Stand<r> is a block that can, for one, <imp>display any item or block<r> by right-clicking with it onto the display stand. It will then be floating around on top. <n>To take it out of there again, just right-click with an empty hand. <n><n>The other feature, however, is that some items can be put onto it, <imp>having special effects<r>. This, however, will require the stand to <imp>get RF<r>. Read more on the next page.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.displayStand.text.2=The <item>Leaf Blower<r> and <item>Advanced Leaf Blower<r> can be placed onto the display stand, resulting in the grass and leaves around it to be blown away. <n><n><item>Potion Rings<r> can be placed onto the display stand. The normal version will give the specified potion effect to <imp>only one<r> living entity in a small area, while the advanced version will <imp>give a potion effect to all living entities<r> in a <imp>big area<r> while using up a significant amount of <imp>RF<r>.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemFilter.name=Item Filter
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.itemFilter.text.1=The <item>Item Filter<r> can be used in <item>Advanced Item Laser Relays<r>, <item>ESDs<r> and <item>Ranged Collectors<r> to <imp>enlargen the size of their whitelist<r>. This can be done by right-clicking with the filter in hand and placing items to be filtered inside of it. The filter can then be placed into any whitelist slot in the desired machine. <n>For more information on this, <imp>hover over the whitelist buttons in the GUIs of whitelistable machines<r>!

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.videoGuide.name=A Video Guide
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.videoGuide.text.1=If you want to have a <imp>visual introduction<r> to see what <item>Actually Additions<r> has to offer, you can watch this really awesome video by a friend of mine, <imp>Booty Toast<r> (yes, weird name, I know). <n>His video covers most of the main stuff the mod has to offer, however it is <imp>a bit outdated<r> and doesn't cover everything. It's still a <imp>great introduction to the mod<r> though.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.videoGuide.page.1.button=Watch Video

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.shockSuppressor.name=Shock Absorber
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.shockSuppressor.text.1=The <item>Shock Absorber<r> is a block that, when supplied with <imp>RF<r>, it will protect an area of <imp>up to <range> blocks around it<r> from any type of <imp>Explosion<r>, be it ghasts, TNT or creepers. <n>Every block that is protected will result in a loss of <imp><rf> RF<r>.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.shockSuppressor.text.2=<i>Credit where credit is due: <r><n><n>Or something like that. <n>Anyways, this thing was thought up and suggested to me by <imp>praetoras<r>. Thanks for that brilliant idea! <n><n><i>What's a fourth wall..?

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.playerProbe.name=Player Probe
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.playerProbe.text.1=The <item>Player Probe<r> can be used to change the player a <item>Player Interface<r> is connected to. If you don't know what the <item>Player Interface<r> does, look it up in here first! <n><n>To use the Player Probe, simply <imp>right-click any player<r> with it and then <imp>right-click the interface<r>. But watch out! <n>The Probe will <imp>notify the player and disconnect<r> from him whenever he sneaks and will also do so when he <imp>leaves the server<r>! <n><n><i>Shenanigans

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.worms.name=Worms
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.worms.text.1=The <item>Worms<r> are a pretty useful species. <n>They will, once <imp>placed down on dirt or grass<r>, help you <imp>till the land<r> around them in a 3x3 area and <imp>keep it wet<r>. <n>Additionally, they will help the crops <imp>grow faster<r> by making the ground nice and soft. <n><n><item>Worms<r> can be gotten by simply <imp>tilling grass<r> with a hoe. <n>If you want to <imp>remove<r> a worm, just <imp>break the block<r> it is on.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.worms.text.2=<i>A worm at work

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.bags.name=Traveler's Sack and Void Sack
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.bags.text.1=<item>Sacks<r> are an easy way to <imp>transport items around<r>, however, they have some additional functions. <n>First of all, in their GUI that is accessed by <imp>right-clicking<r>, they can be set to automatically <imp>suck up items on the ground<r>. Also, they have a couple of <imp>filter slots<r> where you can configure what can actually go into the sacks. <n><n><item>Void Sacks<r> have the same functionality as normal ones, however, they <imp>remove items<r> from the world instead of storing them.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.bags.text.2=Additionally, <item>Sacks<r> can be, when filled up with a lot of items, <imp>right-clicked on a container<r> like a Chest or a <item>Storage Crate<r> to quickly <imp>move all of the items<r> in the sack into the chest.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.empowerer.name=Empowerer
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.empowerer.text.1=The <item>Empowerer<r> is a mid-tier block that can be used to <imp>empower<r> crystals and other items. <n>To use it, items that should be empowered can be <imp>right-clicked onto the Empowerer<r>, and empowering items need to be placed on <item>Display Stands<r> that are <imp>two blocks away<r>, like seen in the <imp>picture on the next page<r>. <n>To then activate the process, <imp>every Display Stand needs to be powered with a lot of RF<r> that is then drained to empower the item on the Empowerer.
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.empowerer.text.2=<i>The placement of the <item>Display Stands<r>
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.empowerer.text.3=<n><n><n><i>Because every mod needs an Infusion Altar

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.fluidLaser.name=Fluid Laser Relays
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.fluidLaser.text.1=The <item>Fluid Laser Relays<r> work much in the same way that normal Laser Relays do, so if you want to know anything about them, visit the <imp>Blocks that use RF<r> section of the manual. <n><n>The thing that makes the <item>Fluid Laser Relay<r> different from the <item>Energy Laser Relay<r>, however, is that it transfers <imp>fluids<r> from internal tanks of blocks into other blocks.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.distributorItem.name=Item Distributor
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.distributorItem.text.1=The <item>Item Distributor<r> is a simple way to split up items and make them go <imp>in different directions<r>. <n><n>The distributor will <imp>pull items into it from the top<r> by itself, and then split them up and <imp>put them<r> out into inventories connected to all of the <imp>other sides<r> of it. <n>It tries to do split the items <imp>equally<r>, however this works best when inputting <imp>one item at a time<r>, which its pulling feature does automatically.

booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.bioReactor.name=Bio Reactor
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.bioReactor.text.1=The <item>Bio Reactor<r> uses all types of <imp>seeds, foodstuffs and plants<r> to <imp>generate RF<r>! <n>To do this, just <imp>place<r> the items <imp>in its GUI<r>. If you try this out, you will notice that it doesn't generate that much power by default. However, the more <imp>different kinds<r> of plants, seeds and foodstuffs it has, the more power it will generate!
