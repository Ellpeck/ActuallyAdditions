#Booklet Chapters
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.intro.name=An Introduction to ActAdd
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.intro.text.1=<i>For too long have the people of Minecraftia toiled under a relentless whip. A whip more hurtful and more injurious than that of any slave-master: inconvenience. Aye, the thousand million inconveniences that make up the grind, that force players to waste hours- nay, days!- chopping wood and farming wheat and other such mundane tasks, just to momentarily escape the remorseless tedium and experience the true joys of Minecraftia, building, caving and adventuring into the beautiful uncharted abundance
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.intro.text.2=<i>of the world. Yet no sooner has one immersed oneself in this creative enterprise than the inconveniences return, like millions of furious bees pestering, stinging, swarming all over you until the game ceases to be enjoyable, and you are driven away from it forever. To that end, a certain Ellpeck has created this Actual Addition to the world of Minecraft, that will allow the player to better engage with the core experiences of the game- building and adventuring- by automating and streamlining the monotony that
booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.intro.text.3=<i>is grinding in Minecraft. Therefore, Ellpeck humbly presents to you this Actually Additions Manual, that shall teach you the ways of this modification and, ultimately, allow you to transcend inconvenience and attain enlightenment. <rs><n><n>                   ~by <imp>Tulkas<r>
