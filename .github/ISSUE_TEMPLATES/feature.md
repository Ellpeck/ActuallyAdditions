<!--- THIS IS A COMMENT. IT WILL NOT SHOW UP IN THE FINAL ISSUE. DO NOT REMOVE THEM. -->

**Describe the feature you would like to see**
<!--- A clear and concise description of what you would like to see in the mod.
PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A FEATURE REQUEST FOR THE FOLLOWING:
- Duplicate ideas. No, it won't boost its chance of being added. Instead, add a thumbs up to ideas that you like.
- Bug/Crash fixes. Use the Bug or Crash report templates, not this.
- Questions. There is a Discord for a reason. -->
**Why do you think this feature should be in the mod?**
<!--- Thoroughly explain why you would like to see it in the mod. For example, will it improve quality of life, integrate well into the existing dimension, or something to expand on an existing idea? Pitch it like you mean it. -->

**Additional context**
<!--- Add any notes, such as whether it was discussed on the Discord, some screenshots for proof-of-concept, or even any code examples if you're after that edge. -->
